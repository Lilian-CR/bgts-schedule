🖤 Black Girls Tech Summit 2025 — Live Schedule 🖤

This simple website was created to help attendees follow the Black Girls Tech Summit 2025: The Shift — Power, Progress & Possibility in real time.
It highlights the session currently taking place and greys out past ones, making it easier to keep track of what’s happening throughout the day — even offline.

<b>About the Project</>

This is a small front-end project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without any backend or commercial purpose.
It was made as a learning exercise and a community contribution — to be useful during the event and showcase practical skills learned at ReDI School of Digital Integration, where I completed the Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp.

I’m currently attending the 2025 Black Girls Tech Summit as a participant, not an organiser or sponsor.
This project is entirely independent and non-commercial.
